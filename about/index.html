<p>Besides computers and math, I&rsquo;ve spent a good portion of my life dedicated to
studying coffee and food. I have <a href="https://uscoffeechampionships.org/">competed as a
barista</a>, helped organize <a href="https://bostontnt.wordpress.com/">coffee community
events</a>, and generally enjoy learning and
talking about coffee. Currently I enjoy cooking at home, but in the past I was
lucky to be able to intern at <a href="https://108.dk/en/homepage-splash/">108</a> and
<a href="https://noma.dk/">Noma</a>, as well as run my own pop-up restaurant
