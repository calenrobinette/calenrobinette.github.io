<h2 id="tomasulos-algorithm">Tomasulo&rsquo;s Algorithm</h2>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine which instructions have inputs ready</li>
<li>Register renaming</li>
</ol>
<p>Originally it was used for floating point instructions, now it&rsquo;s used for everything.</p>
<p>Parts:</p>
<p>Instruction Queue:
Instructions are fetched and put into a queue. FIFO, so they are in instruction order which allows renaming to work appropriately.</p>
<p>Reservation Station:
Instructions are <strong>issued</strong> from the queue to the reservation stations. Usually these have a limiting purpose (ADD/SUB, MUL/DIV). It is in this step that the renaming via the RAT happens, so that instructions can wait for results to be ready if they have true dependencies.</p>
<p>Registers:
When an instruction is put in the reservation station, if the values are ready, they are placed in the instruction in the reservation station.</p>
<p>Execution Unit:
Adder, Multiplier, etc. Instructions are <strong>dispatched</strong> from the associated reservation station. Computes the instruction then <strong>broadcasts</strong> via a BUS the result to the register file, the reservation stations and the RAT. This allows instructions that are waiting for their values to know that they are free to execute.</p>
<p>If the instruction is a load or store:</p>
<ol>
<li>Goes to the address generation unit to compute the address</li>
<li>Insert into the load buffer or store buffer</li>
<li>Queued up to go into memory</li>
<li>When value comes back from memory, it is also broadcast on the bus.</li>
<li>Also the storebuffer is the recipiant of the broadcasts so that if it is true dependent it can get it&rsquo;s  values when they become available.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="issue">Issue</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take the next instruction (<strong>in program order</strong>) from the instruction queue.</li>
<li>Determine where the inputs for the instruction come from (are they already in the register file or will they come from an instruction in one of the registration stations)</li>
<li>Get a free reservation station (This must be of the correct kind and also have a free slot)</li>
<li>Put instruction into the reservation station</li>
<li>Update the RAT for the result value with the reservation station address</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dispatch">Dispatch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latch</strong> produced broadcast results to insts waiting for specific RS result</li>
<li>Decide which inst is ready to execute (has all values, oldest first, longest executing first e.g. MUL/DIV)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="broadcast">Broadcast</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put tag (RS#) &amp; result on Bus</li>
<li>Write to Reg (use RAT to convert RS# -&gt; F#)</li>
<li>Update (clear) RAT</li>
<li>Free RS</li>
</ul>
<p>If one bus, the slower unit result is broadcast in priority. If stale result is broadcast (aka RAT doesn&rsquo;t contain RS# for result), it still latches to RS, but otherwise does nothing.</p>
<p>Per cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue</li>
<li>Capture (latch)</li>
<li>Dispatch</li>
<li>Write Result</li>
</ul>
<p>Same cycle:
Issue -&gt; Dispatch? No
Capture -&gt; Dispatch? No
Update RAT for Issue &amp; Write Result? Yes but Issue updates RAT last</p>
<h2 id="load-and-store">Load and Store</h2>
<p>In Tomasulo&rsquo;s done in order to avoid dependency problems</p>
